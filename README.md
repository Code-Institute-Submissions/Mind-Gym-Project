## <a name="description">Description</a>

The mind Gym is a webpage where his target audience is a completely different audience from the normal gym, this is not focused on the physical condition but more on the mind side, which with the current pandemic we all need to have all support we can get.

* "I want to have different types of classes"

This website is designed to have an approach that induces calm, hence I opt for bright colors like whites and greys.
