## <a name="description">Description</a>

The mind Gym, that is a ficticious gym, is a webpage where his target audience is a completely different audience from the normal gym, this is not focused on the physical condition but more on the mind side, which with the current pandemic we all need to have all support we can get.

## <a name="ux-and-features">UX and Features</a>

This website is designed to have an approach that induces calm, hence I opt for bright colors like whites and greys.

#### 1. Strategy
When I created this website I aimed to target an audience that likes exercizing the mind and body at the same time, there is a clean design to induce the type of
ambient that people will find at the gym.

##### Business Goals

* Increase visibility of the gym
* Increase number of customers
* Increase the reach of the gym


##### Customer Goals

* Have a safe space to relax
* have evidence that it is a reliable space
* Check space reviews
* Verify gym space by the Gallery
* Focusing on Mobile devices so that easily acessible

#### 2. Scope

---
#### 3. Structure
The website was designed with simple layout so that it is easy to navigate and intuitive to all customers. There are essential pages on the navigation bar, which are: 

1. Home
2. Gallery
3. Contact Us

Followed the common guidelines to elaborating the website and feel these pages are suficient in the early stages of the project.

The navbar and footer are common to all pages to induce fluency on the webpage.

The footer has links to social media accounts, at the moment linking to my accounts, and ficticional address for the gym

##### Design

* ###### Colour Scheme
    * Used [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to generate a fluent colour pallet for the webpage.

* ###### Letter type
    * The letter type I chose was Exo and Roboto with Sans serif as a fall out if the letter type fails

* ###### Imagery
    * Images taken from unplash, as it is a ficticional space had to use generic images

* ###### Icons
    * Icons taken from fontawesome that provide context to the relevant section were they are being used
